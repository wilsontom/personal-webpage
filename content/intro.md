Currently a postdoctoral researcher in the High Resolution Metabolomics Laboratory (HRML) at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), Aberystwyth University UK.

My main research theme is the development and application of metabolomics to study the effect of dietary intake and nutritional status on the human urinary metabolome. The key research areas that I contribute to are;
 * Developing targeted LC-MS assays for measuring dietary intake through urinary biomarkers.
 * Applying non-targeted metabolomics and targeted assays to elucidate the effect between dietary status and healthy ageing.
 * Developing of computational tools (in particular R based tools) to aid with the processing and analysis of high dimensional metabolomics data.
